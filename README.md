Team members: Sebastian Foye

Game name: Bird and Squirrel: The Get-to-the-Friend Puzzle Game

The game takes place in a top-down 2d grid. The player solves puzzles by moving Bird and Squirrel the goal, where the goal is to meet each other, while maneuvering past various obstacles.

The game uses motion planning, as the bird and squirrel will need to move to where the player clicks
The game also uses level loading where users can make levels in a text file to play

The game uses the engine from our PA assignments, specifically from PA03-Pathing

The game is interesting/exciting because it will allow the player to control multiple agents separately

Controls:

Move Bird: left click or wasd

Move Squirrel: right click or arrow keys


Objective:

Get Bird and Squirrel to meet each other


Obstacles:
