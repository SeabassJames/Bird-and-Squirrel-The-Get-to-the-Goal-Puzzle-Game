Team members: Sebastian Foye

Game name: Bird and Squirrel: The Get-to-the-Goal Puzzle Game


1.	Provide an overview of your game (give a short description about the game, i.e., core mechanics, game plot, objective, etc.): 

The game takes place in a top-down 2d grid. The player solves puzzles by moving units to their goals on the grid by selecting an agent then clicking on where the agent should move. Different agents can pass over different obstacles, so some agents may need to open pathways for other agents.



2.	What will be the main technical components (game AI, motion planning, physics, procedural content generation) that your game will focus on? 


Motion planning, as units will need to move to where the player clicks




3.	What game engine/tools/libraries will your game use?

The engine from our PA assignments




4.	Why do you think your game is interesting/exciting? 

It will allow the player to control multiple agents separately




5.	How would you divide the tasks among your team members (if more than one)? 

Iâ€™m the only team member
