sfoye CS425 final project

Team members: Sebastian Foye

Game name: Bird and Squirrel: The Get-to-the-Goal Puzzle Game

The game takes place in a top-down 2d grid. The player solves puzzles by moving units to their goals on the grid by selecting an agent then clicking on where the agent should move. Different agents can pass over different obstacles, so some agents may need to open pathways for other agents.

The game uses motion planning, as units will need to move to where the player clicks

The game uses the engine from our PA assignments, specifically from PA03-Pathing

The game is interesting/exciting because it will allow the player to control multiple agents separately
